<p>
    As a final note, your decisions will have effects on the company's reputation. Given the company's lack of social
    action in the past, donating 10% of earnings to {{ cause }} may anger some of your customers, resulting in lower
    payoffs if you choose to switch back to taking no social action. <b>Specifically, when you play a strategy in which
    you do <u>not</u> donate, you will incur a penalty of ($0.50 x number of previous periods
    in which you donated).
    If you play a strategy in which you donate, you will not be subject to this penalty. If you never donate, you will
    not be subject to this penalty. You cannot earn less than $0.00 in any period.</b>
    <br><br>As an example, suppose you choose to donate 10% to {{ cause }} in the first three periods as part of your
    strategy. In the third period, suppose your strategy earns you $3.60 and generates $0.40 in donations.
    For the fourth period, suppose you choose to play the previous CEO's strategy (and not donate). Your
    fourth period earnings will be $3.00 - $1.50 = $1.50, where $3.00 is the original
    payoff that you would earn from the previous CEO's strategy minus a $0.50 penalty for each
    of the three previous rounds in which you donated. If instead you had
    chosen to play the same strategy in the fourth period as you did in the third period, you would receive the
    original (non-penalized) payoff for that strategy, $3.60 and a $0.40 donation.
    <br><br>Please click next to continue to the first period.
